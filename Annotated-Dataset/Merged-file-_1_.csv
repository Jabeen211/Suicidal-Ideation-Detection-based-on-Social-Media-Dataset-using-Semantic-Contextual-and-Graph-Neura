"  Kashmiri Medical student attempted Suicide in Bangladesh.  Junaid Bhat In a football match between Kashmiri students studying in international medical college Bangladesh and the local Bangladeshi students, a small verbal exchange turned violent. In response the college administration punished only kashmiri student barring him from appearing in examinations for 6 months.  The victim tried to commit suicide two times but fortunately was saved by his friends.The college administration is not ready to listen to kashmiri students and is not even bothered to cancel the suspension of student from appearing in exams.  Talking to kashmiri students, they said that at home everyone knows Bangladesh is a safe country but these issues will damage the confidence of kashmiri parents while sending their wards to Bangladesh. Kashmiri students are continuously on protest. Now we request college administration and the local police station to solve the issue.Play Video,",1

Our First work has been published in 'Lancet EClinicalMedicine'. We have collected data from 1,20,000 teenagers from 52 countries including Bangladesh. According to that, we have found out that -  ◼️ Teenagers with less probability of committing suicide have parents, who understand their problems, keep in mind their studies and free time, ensure their privacy. ◼️ 1 out of 4 teenagers, aged from 12 to 15, are thinking, trying, or planning about committing suicide. In this case, girls have a high probability of committing suicide in comparison with boys. ◼️ 1 out of 3 teenagers has said that their Parents understand their problems and keep in mind their studies and free time. 2 out of 3 have said that their Parents ensure their Privacy.
